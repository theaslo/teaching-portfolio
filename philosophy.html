<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>Physics is a powerful framework for developing disciplined reasoning, analytical skills, and intellectual curiosity. My teaching is dynamic and reflective—adapting to student needs, grounded in clear learning objectives, and guided by inclusive practices and meaningful assessments.</p>

<p>At UConn Hartford, I teach introductory physics courses for students from diverse academic and personal backgrounds, including many first-generation college students. I scaffold instruction to support students with varying levels of math preparedness, integrating review of algebra and trigonometry where needed. I promote active learning through peer instruction, group whiteboarding, live polling, and lab-based inquiry.</p>

<p>My upper-level teaching at Storrs (e.g., PHYS 3201) applies the same instructional philosophy with a deeper emphasis on mathematical rigor and abstract reasoning. I aim to foster student confidence in solving complex problems, designing experiments, and thinking like physicists.</p>

<p>I also mentor undergraduate researchers and have supported students in earning competitive grants and presenting at symposia. My work integrates Generative AI through Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to promote computational fluency and problem-solving support.</p>

<p>I regularly engage in pedagogical development via CETL workshops, the Mobile Summer Teaching Institute, and collaborative work through the Hartford Teaching Matters Lab.</p>
