  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
  <p>My teaching philosophy centers on the belief that physics is a powerful framework for developing disciplined reasoning, analytical skills, and intellectual curiosity. I see teaching as a dynamic and reflective practice—one that must continuously adapt to meet the needs of students and be guided by clear learning objectives, inclusive practices, and meaningful assessments. I aim to cultivate a classroom environment that is both rigorous and welcoming, where students can build confidence in their ability to think critically and solve complex problems.</p>

  <p>At UConn Hartford, I teach introductory physics courses for students from diverse academic and personal backgrounds—many of whom are pre-health, life science, or general education students, and often first-generation college attendees. These students frequently bring a range of prior preparation in math and science, and my teaching approach intentionally meets them where they are. I focus on supporting the development of conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills through scaffolded instruction that integrates review of foundational algebra and trigonometry as needed. I design activities that encourage active engagement, peer collaboration, and incremental mastery of quantitative reasoning.</p>

  <p>I believe that students learn best when they are given opportunities to engage deeply with the material. I incorporate a variety of teaching strategies to promote this, including peer instruction, group whiteboard work, live polling, and guided inquiry in labs. These approaches help students feel more invested in the material and reduce the isolation often felt in introductory STEM courses. In my lab sections, I emphasize experimental design, data interpretation, and connection to real-world physical principles, moving beyond rote procedures. I also use low-cost data acquisition tools and simulations to help students visualize abstract ideas, and I supplement lectures with video tutorials and guided problem walkthroughs to support different learning modalities.</p>

  <p>In addition to my regular teaching at Hartford, I occasionally teach at the Storrs campus as needed. I have taught PHYS 3201: Electricity and Magnetism, an upper-division course for physics majors that requires a strong grasp of vector calculus and abstract reasoning. Teaching this course keeps me engaged with the major curriculum and provides an opportunity to apply my instructional philosophy in a more advanced and mathematically rigorous context.</p>

  <p>I view my role not only as an instructor but also as a mentor. I actively guide undergraduate students in research, with projects in theoretical and computational physics. My mentorship emphasizes skill-building, scientific communication, and intellectual ownership of their work. Several students have received competitive internal awards such as the Summer Undergraduate Research Fund (SURF) and UConn Hartford Student Research Grants, and have presented their findings at university symposia. These experiences serve as capstone extensions of the learning outcomes I emphasize in the classroom—precision, curiosity, and self-efficacy.</p>

  <p>To ensure that my teaching evolves in step with students’ needs and broader disciplinary changes, I engage in ongoing pedagogical development. I have completed several CETL-led courses and workshops focused on inclusive teaching, active learning, and assessment design. I also participated in the Mobile Summer Teaching Institute, which provided a deep dive into course design principles, learning outcomes alignment, and reflective teaching practices. At the Hartford campus, I collaborate regularly with faculty across disciplines through the Teaching Matters Lab, where we share strategies to address student preparedness, promote equity, and refine instructional tools for foundational STEM courses.</p>

  <p>I have also been awarded both CLAS and UConn Hartford Teaching Enhancement Grants to support innovations in teaching, including redesigning laboratory experiences and implementing flipped classroom models. I seek student feedback through mid-semester reflections and use this data to adjust pacing, revise instructional methods, and introduce new supports.</p>

  <p>One area of ongoing innovation in my teaching involves the integration of Generative AI. I have developed a suite of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) that allow students to interact with large language models for tutoring, coding, and research exploration. These tools help students overcome technical hurdles and provide just-in-time support for physics problem-solving, and practicing the scientific knowledge. By piloting these tools in my classes and research supervision, I aim to foster independent learning, computational literacy, and familiarity with the emerging technological landscape that will shape scientific work in the coming decades.</p>

  <p>While my current position does not formally include graduate-level teaching, I maintain an active research profile and mentor advanced undergraduates in areas typically introduced at the graduate level, such as field theory, parton distributions, and applied computation in nuclear physics. I stay current in both physics and educational best practices to ensure that my courses are pedagogically sound and intellectually up to date.</p>

  <p>In all my teaching, I strive to uphold the values of clarity, intentionality, equity, and reflection. I see teaching not only as a transmission of knowledge, but as a transformative process that empowers students to see themselves as capable learners and thinkers. Whether a student pursues a career in physics, health sciences, or another discipline entirely, I hope they leave my course with the confidence that they can tackle complex problems, reason rigorously, and continue learning beyond the classroom.</p>
