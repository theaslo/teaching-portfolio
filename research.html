  <h1>Research, Scholarship, and Creative Work</h1>

  <p>My research focuses on theoretical nuclear physics, particularly the structure of hadrons through analytic and model-based parton distribution functions. I work with the Covariant Parton Model and analytic solutions to the DGLAP evolution equations to understand the momentum and spin structure of mesons.</p>

  <h2>Current Research Directions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentoring Thomas Tarutin and Devesh Kartnik on pion and kaon distributions in the Covariant Parton Model</li>
    <li>Developing nondiagonal DVCS and DVMP observables for future EIC physics programs</li>
    <li>Preparing publication on kaon PDFs based on analytic modeling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Student Research Involvement</h2>
  <p>I have mentored undergraduate students on competitive projects that resulted in awards, conference presentations, and graduate admissions. Former student Matthew Markovich worked on DGLAP evolution and is now pursuing a Ph.D. at Stony Brook.</p>

  <h2>Pedagogical Innovation</h2>
  <p>I develop Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that support GenAI integration in physics learning. These tools enable guided problem-solving, conceptual development, and computational support across instruction and research mentorship.</p>

  <h2>Goals for the Next 5–10 Years</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Expand analytic modeling of parton distributions, including kaon and pion structure</li>
    <li>Contribute to phenomenological predictions for exclusive EIC processes</li>
    <li>Advance the use of MCP tools in undergraduate physics education and coding literacy</li>
    <li>Grow collaborations around AI-assisted research workflows and computation</li>
  </ul>
