  <h1>Student Evaluations</h1>

  <p>I regularly collect student feedback through official SETs and mid-semester reflections. These evaluations highlight my commitment to clarity, supportiveness, and rigorous instruction across diverse physics courses at UConn.</p>

  <h2>Representative Student Comments</h2>
  <blockquote>“The instructor was very kind and interested in the students’ success.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“This professor makes it feel easier. I like how she teaches.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“She always made sure all questions were answered and heard as well as student feedback.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“She is extremely dedicated and gave me the confidence to work hard and succeed.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“She’s genuinely interested in students understanding the content. Very kind and respectful.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“Physics has never made more sense to me than it does now.”</blockquote>

  <h2>Quantitative Ratings</h2>
  <p>Across multiple semesters and course levels, students consistently rate the following above 4.5/5:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“The instructor communicated ideas and information clearly.”</li>
    <li>“The instructor was approachable and responsive to student questions.”</li>
    <li>“The instructor created a learning environment that supported my success.”</li>
    <li>“I learned a lot in this course.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Detailed PDFs of student evaluations are available upon request or for committee review.</p>
