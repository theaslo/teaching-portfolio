<h2>Student Evaluations</h2>

<p>Student feedback highlights my approachability, dedication, and effectiveness in supporting learning. Below are selected student quotes from recent SETs (Student Evaluation of Teaching):</p>

<blockquote>“The instructor was very kind and interested in the students’ success.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This professor makes it feel easier. I like how she teaches.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“She always made sure all questions were answered and heard as well as student feedback.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“She is extremely dedicated and gave me the confidence to work hard and succeed.”</blockquote>

<p>I use mid-semester feedback to adjust pacing, integrate new supports, and revise instructional methods in real-time. Evaluation scores remain consistently strong across both introductory and upper-division physics courses.</p>
