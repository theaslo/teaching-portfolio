  <h1>Undergraduate and Graduate Mentorship</h1>

  <h2>Undergraduate Research and Advising</h2>
  <p>I actively mentor undergraduate students in theoretical and computational physics research, curriculum innovation, and academic advising. Highlights include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Matthew Markovich</strong> – Former research student; worked on analytic solutions to DGLAP evolution equations. Currently pursuing PhD at Stony Brook.</li>
    <li><strong>Devesh Kartnik</strong> – Current undergraduate researcher studying kaon distribution functions in the Covariant Parton Model.</li>
    <li><strong>Nicholas Zimmerman</strong> – Advised honors thesis project on magnetic monopoles.</li>
    <li><strong>Jakub Pierog</strong> – Pre-med student collaborating on Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for physics education, with a focus on computational integration and GenAI-assisted learning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Graduate Student Mentorship</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Thomas Tarutin</strong> – Beginning M.S. studies under my supervision in Fall 2025, continuing work on pion distribution functions in the Covariant Parton Model.</li>
    <li><strong>Andrea Mejia</strong> – PhD student for whom I serve as an associate advisor; advising in theoretical nuclear physics and research development.</li>
  </ul>
